the software in this directory requires installation of liblo and pyliblo.

the gui software requires wxpython, and if you get a strange error in cubecolourdialog, make the following change in 
/usr/lib/python2.6/dist-packages/wx-2.8-gtk2-unicode/wx/lib/agw/cubecolourdialog.py
or wherever cubecolordialog is stored:

in class Colour __init__ (line 1367 in my version) change: 

   self.alpha = colour.Alpha()
to:
   self._alpha = colour.Alpha()

hopefully this will be fixed in the next version of wxpython
